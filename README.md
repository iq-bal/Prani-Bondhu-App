It looks like the markdown syntax isn't rendering as expected. This may be due to the way certain characters or formatting elements are used in the markdown, like **bold** or *italic*. I suggest the following steps to ensure proper rendering on GitHub:

1. Make sure your markdown syntax uses `*` for bullet points and proper headings with `##` for sections.
2. Use backticks (`` ` ``) for inline code or paths.
3. Ensure proper placement of images and tables.

Here is the fixed version of the `README.md` file for you:
